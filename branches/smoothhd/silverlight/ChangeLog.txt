*** Version 2.1.000 ***
2008-12-14	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

- Completed work on template/skinning system for OVP v2.1 
   > No player code changes needed for styling
   > look and feel is handled by a xaml template outside of the player dll 
   
- Added Quality Meter 
   > The number of bars indicates how close to the full bitrate you are receiving 
   > The color is white by default and goes green if the content is HD (480 lines or more) 
   > Color goes yellow with over 10% framedrop, and red at over 25% drop or less than 240 lines/res 
   > Tooltip shows more details, including resolution, bitrate in use, and framedrop (if any) 
   
- added new heuristic for resolution cap based on player window size
   > added ability to adaptive code to report the current resolution correctly
   > now will cap to 848x480 unless fullscreen, saving bandwidth and cycles
   > if capped will report in tooltip
   
SmoothHD Specific
- Reskinned OVP v2.1 to emulate look and feel of existing SmoothHD 
   > SmoothHD will now inherits features such as draggable slider, controls in Fullscreen,
       click video to pause, dbl-click FS, etc.. - this in itself should take care of the major UI complaints 
   > Playlists and manifests are now feeds from StreamOS (previously hardcoded xml), the content hasn't moved 
   > Fit player into background more cleanly, and added click spots for all logos, like IIS and Akamai 
   
- improved install experience: page is now html other than player and playlist 
   > If SL not installed, page and links are intact, but player area has an install link, and requirements text.
   > previously was all silverlight, would show nothing but install button if not installed 
   
- Dynamic player scaling
    > When bitrate-in-use or browser size changes, an algorithm determines the best size of the player 
    > It will only choose from HD resolutions, 480p or greater, leaving the minimum still at 848x480  
    > The client must have the bandwidth capability, CPU, and browser real-estate to justify upsizing
    > Fullscreen still works as before, and will fill the screen regardless of the content being received


*** Version 2.0.60 ***
2008-12-02	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

- Created new custom controls Menu and MenuItem, simplifies player greatly.
- Tweaked namespaces to get all controls together
- Created ThemeManager, implementing ImplicitStyleManager, to allow for runtime theme changing
- Added new StartUp Param for theme, must be resource URI such as: 'OVPImplementation;component/themes/Default.xaml'
  (standard Silverlight syntax)  Themes must be xaml files in a referenced assembly, compiled as a resource.
- Removed explicit styles on buttons, controls allowing external themes
- created 'CustomContentControl' with derived class for content of each control
  As styles can be keyed by type, this allows overriding button/control content 
  without overriding the entire player template!
- Fix to volumebar when muted, volume change unmutes
- Changed to dynamic stackcontrol for button container
- Added Previous and Next button
- New parser to resolve xml playlist links in MediaRSS Feeds
- fix for controlbar sizing in fullscreen
- rearranged parameter parser to allow for utility usage outside of player
- Added support for external playlists, can be plugged into player

  

*** Version 2.0.30 ***
2008-11-26	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

- implemented playlist downloading in connection class where it belonged
- new bindtemplate() that is more dynamic
- Fixed url encoding issue so percentages work for height/width on Mac.
- Fixed bug (typo) that was causing crash when loading adaptive dll
- various styling improvements
- some improvements to options menu, zorder, etc
- new log viewer control, still a work in progress
- Added new 'Fill' stretch mode, maps to Silverlight's UniformToFill.  Like stretch, but preserves aspect by clipping
- shrink duration and position text to MM:SS unless clip is over an hour, then show HH:MM:SS


*** Version 2.0.26 ***
2008-11-19	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

- Tweaked the project to eliminate several files/folders, including Bin, ClientBin, and Silverlight.js
- New prebuild.cmd pre build script updates versions on all projects, including subversion revision.


*** Version 2.0.24 ***
2008-11-19	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

// Code changes (from v1.8)
- Based on final Silverlight v2.0 runtime
	
*- Support for MediaRSS, Reference files, and direct media content
- Add support for a single source, as well as a playlist
- Fixes for Seek bar / duration to support live content
	
*- Completed configuration tool
- Error box if content can't be played
- More stats incl. bitrates avail. and in use (video only), measured bandwidth, resolution, and buffer values
*- New options menu with scaling and debug statistics toggle
*- Allow runtime changes to scaling mode, matched terminology to flash ver.
   
- Hide controls in full screen mode, show if mouse is near bottom
- Double-click on surface causes fullscreen toggle
- Single click on surface toggles pause
- allow click anywhere on volume bar for value change  (instead of having to precisely grab the indicator)
- allow sliding the volume / seek bar with mouse 
    
*- Playlist Side by Side as well as overlay
- Support for link/embed


// UI / Template changes
- Tooltip for Seek bar, shows the time you are hovering over
- Tooltip for Volume bar with current value
- Tweaks to other tooltips, making them conditional (play/pause, mute/unmute, FullScreen/Restore)
- gray mute button on click
- 'Paused box' in middle of media surface
- Translucent background for stats box
    
- increase text size on time indicators on each side of seek bar
- modded buttons to look more like flash version
- Blacked out background of frame, behind player
   
   
// Known issues list
- sometimes clicks aren't registered in the options menu 
	* This'll be fixed later when it is made into a custom menu control
- Issues with ShowPlaylist and ShowChapters options because feeds load async
	* Dropped them from the config tool for now, will add later
- Need better/more consistent error handling, anything not caught currently wipes out the player with a big error.  
	* Good enough for now, but I'd like to catch these internally and give a silverlight error overlay on the player, reserving the big ugly errors for actual problems with silverlight itself.  
- Unit tests are very behind, and will need to be caught up with soon


// Planned for future release
- 'video size' option, as opposed to just player size
- Colors and themes
- Overlay mode for player controls - currently always below player, but will hide on fullscreen
- Debug logs - proving difficult in silverlight, there is no debug/trace listener.  
	* Will have to roll own debugging system / attach to tracer in adaptive code.
