Open Video Player is a community site dedicated to sharing best practices around video player development. You can download player source code, reference plug-ins for advertising technologies as well as get advice from a community of designers, developers and content owners. 

The goal of the project was to give the industry a resource that promotes existing best practices around rich media development. Over the last three years thousands of applications have been developed based on this standard powering millions of video plays.

As the Open Video Player initiative attracted a larger group of supporters it was agreed the project should be given to the Internet community. Today Openvideoplayer.com houses the latest versions of the player foundation – called the media framework - and cultivates it’s use as a best practice approach to professional online player development. The goal of the site under an open source license with optional contribution parameters is to simply make Internet video playback better and encourage the proliferation of online video. We encourage contributions and ideas on ways to achieve this ongoing goal.
