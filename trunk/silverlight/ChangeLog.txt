Version 2.0.24 
2008-11-19	Nick Brookins <nbrookin at akamai d0t com>

// Code changes (from v1.8)
- Based on final Silverlight v2.0 runtime
	
- Support for MediaRSS, Reference files, and direct media content
- Add support for a single source, as well as a playlist
- Fixes for Seek bar / duration to support live content
	
- Completed configuration tool
- Error box if content can't be played
- More stats incl. bitrates avail. and in use (video only), measured bandwidth, resolution, and buffer values
- New options menu with scaling and debug statistics toggle
- Allow runtime changes to scaling mode, matched terminology to flash ver.
   
- Hide controls in full screen mode, show if mouse is near bottom
- Double-click on surface causes fullscreen toggle
- Single click on surface toggles pause
- allow click anywhere on volume bar for value change  (instead of having to precisely grab the indicator)
- allow sliding the volume / seek bar with mouse 
    
- Playlist Side by Side as well as overlay
- Support for link/embed


// UI / Template changes
- Tooltip for Seek bar, shows the time you are hovering over
- Tooltip for Volume bar with current value
- Tweaks to other tooltips, making them conditional (play/pause, mute/unmute, FullScreen/Restore)
- gray mute button on click
- 'Paused box' in middle of media surface
- Translucent background for stats box
    
- increase text size on time indicators on each side of seek bar
- modded buttons to look more like flash version
- Blacked out background of frame, behind player
   
   
// Known issues list
- sometimes clicks aren't registered in the options menu 
	* This'll be fixed later when it is made into a custom menu control
- Issues with ShowPlaylist and ShowChapters options because feeds load async
	* Dropped them from the config tool for now, will add later
- Need better/more consistent error handling, anything not caught currently wipes out the player with a big error.  
	* Good enough for now, but I'd like to catch these internally and give a silverlight error overlay on the player, reserving the big ugly errors for actual problems with silverlight itself.  
- Unit tests are very behind, and will need to be caught up with soon


// Planned for future release
- 'video size' option, as opposed to just player size
- Colors and themes
- Overlay mode for player controls - currently always below player, but will hide on fullscreen
- Debug logs - proving difficult in silverlight, there is no debug/trace listener.  
	* Will have to roll own debugging system / attach to tracer in adaptive code.
