The following files are created from a build:

Bin\..               - Libraries and language resources provided with Silverlight Runtime
ClientBin\OVP.xap    - This is the player binary file compiled from the OVP source
index.html           - The configuration tool, which creates the object tag for you to embed in your html page
preview.html		 - The page used by the config tool for creating a preview player window
example.html         - An example page with player, can be modified by replacing the object tag with one from config tool
Web.config			 - USed to allow debugging if running from Visual Studio.NET
Silverlight.js       - A JavaScript file, used to assist in installing Silverlight on new systems

These files can be placed on any web server (apache, IIS, embedded, etc), there are no server side components or requirements.  The object tag from the config tool can be dropped into any HTML page (or aspx, php, etc..).  If the user doesn't have silverlight, the included js file will provide an easy install experience.  Note the player will not work if you directly launch the html from your disk, this is a security violation for silverlight.

The easiest way to deploy a player would be to configure it from the tool, copy the generated embed code, and paste it into the example.html file, replacing the existing code.  The page could then be easily built in to an existing website.

Silverlight projects compile to XAP files, which are actually just zip files that include the required DLLs, manifest, and XAML files.  This isn't strictly necessary knowledge, but good to know. 

In the case of OVP.xap the contents are:

AppManifest.xaml            - The file manifests, provided in xaml and xml forms
AppManifest.xml
System.Xml.Linq.dll         - A Silverlight runtime library, included because it is referenced by our project
OpenVideoPlayer.dll         - The compiled Player, implemented as a custom Silverlight Control
OVPImplementation.dll       - The Silverlight application, essentially a blank page with the player control placed on it.
